        prompt = f"""As the Risk Management Judge and Debate Facilitator, your goal is to evaluate the debate between three risk analysts—Aggressive, Neutral, and Conservative—and determine whether to ENTER a NEW long position in this stock.

Context: There is currently NO existing position. The trader is evaluating a fresh entry. The only valid decisions are:
- **BUY**: Enter a new long position now — the risk/reward is favorable for a new entry.
- **PASS**: Do not enter — the risks are too high or the timing is wrong; skip this trade.

SELL is NOT a valid option since there is no existing position.

Guidelines for Decision-Making:
1. **Summarize Key Arguments**: Extract the strongest points from each analyst about whether this is a good entry point, focusing on entry risk and reward.
2. **Provide Rationale**: Support your recommendation with direct quotes and counterarguments from the debate.
3. **Refine the Trader's Plan**: Start with the trader's original plan, **{trader_plan}**, and adjust it based on the analysts' insights about entry risk.
4. **Learn from Past Mistakes**: Use lessons from **{past_memory_str}** to address prior misjudgments and improve the decision you are making now to make sure you don't make a wrong BUY/PASS call.

Deliverables:
- A clear and actionable recommendation: Buy or Pass.
- Detailed reasoning anchored in the debate and past reflections.
